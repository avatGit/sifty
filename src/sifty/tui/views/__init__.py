"""Content views — one per sidebar section.

The sidebar now lists seven top-level sections; the "free up space" and
"installed software" screens (including Updates) are consolidated into the
tabbed ``CleanView`` and ``AppsSystemView`` groups (see ``group.py``). The
individual sub-views still exist and stay reachable via ``SUBVIEW_ROUTES``
(deep-linking into a tab).
